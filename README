V.A.L.I.S. is a minimal Linux-based operating system consisting of a machine-specific Linux 
kernel, and an initramfs that only provides systemd and a container host.

Download source code:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jjkivilu/valis.git

Build:
make image

Boot:
1. Create an empty FAT32 media
2. Create directory /EFI/boot to it
3. Copy build/tmp/images/$(MACHINE)/bzImage-initramfs-$(MACHINE).bin as /EFI/boot/bootx64.efi
4. Reboot target with the media

Develop:
VALIS is based on Poky, the Yocto Project reference distribution. All VALIS-specific sources 
reside under meta-valis. Other layers such as poky and meta-intel exist as submodules. Run 
"make help" for instructions on how to use the Makefile wrapper for bitbake.

Supported MACHINE targets:
- qemux86-64		Test run under KVM
- intel-corei7-64	Generic modern PCs with EFI firmware
  - minnowboard-turbot	Derived target for Minnowboard Turbot family and possibly other Atom E3800
